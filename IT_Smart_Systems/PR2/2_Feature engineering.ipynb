A z-score specifies the location of the observation within a distribution (in numbers of standard deviations respect to the mean of the distribution). The sign of the z-score (+ or - ) indicates whether the observation is above (+) or below ( - ) the mean.\n","\n","The shape of a standardised (or z-scored normalised) distribution will be identical to the original distribution of the variable. If the original distribution is normal, then the standardised distribution will be normal. But, if the original distribution is skewed, then the standardised distribution of the variable will also be skewed.
